## gmakemake
As a computer science major at RIT, you have likely taken (or will take) mechanics of programming. In that class you might have seen or used a command line tool called `gmakemake` to create makefiles for C programming projects. 

If you are looking to use this tool outside of class, you're in luck because the source code written by Sidney Marshall (swm) has been published at http://www.cs.rit.edu/~swm/makemake/ and a [github fork](https://github.com/noahrichards/util) has cropped up as well.
