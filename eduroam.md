## An Overview

Starting after 2022 commencement RIT is replacing the 'RIT' wifi network with a larger, multi-university 'eduroam' network. This can lead to some confusion, especially for anyone not running MacOS or Windows.

## Purpose of this Guide
This guide aims to provide Linux users at RIT with an alternate to the [official RIT Helpdesk guidance](https://help.rit.edu/sp/?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0040935) for users who want more manual control over their connection than is provided by the SecureW2 utility that RIT's instructions guide people to.

## General Steps

This guide contains several methods, each for a different purpose. At the bottom of this page, there are links to specific instructions for each currently supported networking tools. However, as a general rule, these are the high-level steps. This may be useful for creating additional information for your preferred network manager, should it not currently be documented.

1. Generate a personal certificate, according to [this tutorial](./certificates).
2. Configure your network manager with the following settings.
    - SSID/Network Name: eduroam
    - Key Management: WPA-EAP
    - EAP method: TLS
    - Anonymous Identity: anonymous@rit.edu
    - Domain: radius.rit.edu
    - Phase2/Inner Identity/"Identity": abc1234@rit.edu
    - Phase2/Inner Password: [Your RIT Password]
    - Location of the CACert
    - Location of the personal certificate and/or key
    - Certificate Password: created previously

## Network Management Options

- [Network Manager](./eduroamConfigs/networkManager)
- [nmcli/Network Manager CLI](./eduroamConfigs/nmcli)
- [iwd](./eduroamConfigs/iwd)
- [wpa_supplicant](./eduroamConfigs/wpa_supplicant)


## Alternate - RIT-WiFi

If you are unable to connect using certificates, you can follow the [ITS RESNet manual registration instructions](https://www.rit.edu/its/resnet/manual-registration).
