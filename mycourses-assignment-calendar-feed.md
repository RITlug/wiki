#### Tips
- **Auto-Refresh:** Some calendar applications automatically refresh ICS feeds periodically, but you can often adjust this in the calendar settings to ensure your assignments are always up-to-date.
- **Multiple Courses:** If you’re enrolled in multiple courses, all the assignments should appear in the same ICS feed. If not, ensure you’ve selected the appropriate calendar in D2L Brightspace.

#### Troubleshooting
- **Missing Events:** If certain assignments or events are missing, try re-subscribing to the feed or checking the calendar settings in D2L Brightspace to ensure all relevant courses are included.
- **Sync Issues:** If your calendar application is not syncing properly, consider manually refreshing the calendar or adjusting the sync frequency in your app's settings.

This method ensures that you stay on top of your assignments by integrating them seamlessly into your daily schedule.
