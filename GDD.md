There's a lot more you can do with linux than you might imagine.

- Unreal Engine 4 can be used on Linux and will export Linux-native builds of your games (Unity and CryEngine can also export this way)
- Godot is a completely FOSS engine which is sorta the Linux gamedev engine right now.
- Sites like GOG and Steam support Linux very well, there's really no reason not to
- Linux users are often willing to help contribute back and debug software
