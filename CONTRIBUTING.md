# How to contribute

## Running jekyll locally
(these are pretty quick and dirty instructions, feel free to submit a PR to clean them up)
Jekyll makes things pretty easy, they have instructions here https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ but as long as you have some of the ruby basics (mostly bundler i think) installed you shouldnt need to install jekyll system-wide. it should be just bundle install followed by bundle exec jekyll serve to run a development jekyll server inside the bundler environment where all the dependencies should have been installed
