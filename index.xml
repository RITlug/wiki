      <description>gmakemake As a computer science major at RIT, you have likely taken (or will take) mechanics of programming. In that class you might have seen or used a command line tool called gmakemake to create makefiles for C programming projects.
If you are looking to use this tool outside of class, you&amp;rsquo;re in luck because the source code written by Sidney Marshall (swm) has been published at http://www.cs.rit.edu/~swm/makemake/ and a github fork has cropped up as well.</description>

      <description>An Overview Starting after 2022 commencement RIT is replacing the &amp;lsquo;RIT&amp;rsquo; wifi network with a larger, multi-university &amp;rsquo;eduroam&amp;rsquo; network. While this change may seem straightforward, RIT has decided to use EAP-TLS authentication rather than using MSCHAPV2. This is not a widespread practice, even among other universities who utilize the eduroam network. This can lead to some confusion, especially for anyone not running MacOS or Windows. This guide hopes to clear that up.</description>

      <description>Using Network-manager These instructions are for network-manager specifically, but should be adaptable for any system
Step 1: Navigate to https://vpn.rit.edu from a linux device and sign in
Step 2: Click the button to download the anyconnect client for linux. You should get a roughly 5-6 megabyte .sh script file.
Step 3: Extract This installer script contains an encoded tarball which makes up the bulk of the file. To extract it, use this script.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more you can do with linux than you might imagine.
 Unreal Engine 4 can be used on Linux and will export Linux-native builds of your games (Unity and CryEngine can also export this way) Godot is a completely FOSS engine which is sorta the Linux gamedev engine right now. Sites like GOG and Steam support Linux very well, there&amp;rsquo;s really no reason not to Linux users are often willing to help contribute back and debug software  </description>
