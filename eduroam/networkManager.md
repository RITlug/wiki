## NetworkManager Tutorial

This is the complete instruction list for configuring `wpa_supplicant`. These instructions use the `P12` certificate, although the `PEM` will also work properly.

## Requirements
Currently, the only required software required for this is a modern web browser, and a desktop environment compatible with NetworkManager. Desktop managers that default to using NetworkManager include KDE, GNOME, LXDE, Cinnamon, and MATE.

## Instructions

1. Generate a personal certificate according to [this tutorial](/certificates.md).

2. Click the wifi logo in the status bar, and then select `eduroam`.

3. Enter the configuration details in the window that appears. If the password field turns red it means the password is incorrect.

## Troubleshooting

If you cannot connect to the internet after attempting to use this tutorial, go to the [nmcli](./nmcli.md) documentation, and ensure that all settings are correct. There are also more troubleshooting steps listed there.
