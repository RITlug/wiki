5. Once you are logged in, you will be asked to create a certificate. Enter a name you would like to give this certificate in the 'User Description' input box, then, click the 'Create' button.

6. You will then be prompted to create a password to protect your private key. This will be needed to set up eduroam on a new device. If you are unsure, you can use [1Password's public generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/?) which has a "memorable password" mode. The password you choose must be at least six (but no more than 16) characters long and contain a letter, number, and symbol.

7. Choose a format to download your certificate in. Check the page in this wiki for your network manager to see which version you will need. Most managers will use `P12`.
