## Android Tutorial

This is the complete instruction list for configuring Android to connect to eduroam. These instructions use the `P12` certificate.

## Instructions

Generate a personal certificate according to [this tutorial](./certificates.md).

### Installing the certificates

1. Open the Settings application and navigate to 'Install certificates'.  
   This may vary by phone manufacturer, as some phone manufacturers like to customize their settings menus. You can search for this menu option if you aren't able to navigate to it manually.
   
   On my Moto e5 running near-stock Android 8.1, the path is 'Network & Internet' > 'Wi-Fi' > 'Wi-Fi Preferences' > 'Advanced' > 'Install certificates'.
2. Clicking 'Install certificates' should open up a file picker. Navigate to your user certificate, which is likely in your 'Downloads' folder, and choose that. You will need to enter the password you chose earlier for the certificate, and then enter a name for the certificate. Make sure under 'Credential use' you pick 'Wi-Fi'.

3. Install the RIT root CA. Make sure you also select 'Wi-Fi' for 'Credential use' in this dialog as well.  

   Note: Some phones may not allow you to install CA certificates, and if your phone is one of them, you may skip this step. Having the RIT root CA installed is recommended but not necessary.

### Connecting to the hotspot

Connect to the 'eduroam' hotspot. A settings menu should open. Input the following:
1. Make sure 'EAP method' is set to 'TLS'.
2. Select the RIT root CA under 'CA certificate'.  
   If you were unable to install this certificate, select 'Do not validate' or an equivalent option.
3. Enter 'radius.rit.edu' for the domain.
4. Select your user certificate under 'User certificate'.
5. Under 'Identity', enter '[your RIT username]@main.ad.rit.edu'.
