Welcome to the RIT linux wiki!

If you are here for information on eduroam, you'll likely want the [main eduroam page](./eduroam). This page is a great starting point if you want to learn more about eduroam or connect a device.

There are also a few other pages you might find interesting:
- [How to connect to the RIT VPN in linux](./RIT-VPN)
