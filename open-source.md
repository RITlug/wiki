If you're looking to contribute to open source software that's in use at RIT, First you need to find it. This can be a little hit or miss at times. This article hopes to provide a general roadmap of what kinds of software is currently in use on campus as open source projects.


## Sources of Open Source

Here are a few major categories that encompass many likely (and quite broad) sources of open source creation at RIT:

- **University FOSS** - Software owned by the university (i.e. made by paid university employees, student employees, or co op students). Examples: [OPEN@RIT](https://openr.it/) ([github](https://github.com/FOSSRIT)), [Student Government](https://www.rit.edu/studentgovernment/)
- **Club FOSS** - Software made by student clubs and similar organizations (like Special Interest Houses) at RIT. Examples: 
  - [The Construct](https://github.com/TheConstructRIT)
  - [Computer Science House](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/)
  - [Linux Users Group](https://github.com/ritlug) 
  - [RIT Space Exploration](https://github.com/rit-spex)
  - [RIT Launch Initiative](https://github.com/RIT-Launch-Initiative)
  - [Electric Vehicle Team](https://github.com/RIT-EVT)

## Notable Open Source at RIT

Here are some especially notable open projects that the average RIT student is likely to have used or heard of throughout their RIT career:

- [PawPrints](https://pawprints.rit.edu/) (Student Government, [repo](https://github.com/ritstudentgovernment/PawPrints/))
- [Naps.rit.edu](https://naps.rit.edu/) (Student Government, [repo](https://github.com/ritstudentgovernment/Atlas/))
- [Schedulemaker](https://schedule.csh.rit.edu/) (CSH, [repo](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/schedulemaker))



## How to find new open source software at RIT

There are many more examples of smaller open source projects at RIT (such as this website) that are constantly changing as students are accepted to/ graduate from RIT. Some of the best ways to find them include:
- Joining student groups (such as RITLUG, the clubs listed above, etc) and asking around
- Observing what software you use or see during your time at RIT (such as discord bots, apps or websites you hear about, kiosks where you swipe your ID, posters advertising student projects)
