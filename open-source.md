If you're looking to contribute to open source software that's in use at RIT, First you need to find it. This can be a little hit or miss at times. This article hopes to provide a general roadmap of what kinds of software is currently in use on campus as open source projects.


## Types of Open Source

I've been generally categorizing open source at RIT into a few major categories:

- **University FOSS** - Software owned by the university (i.e. made by paid university employees, student employees, or co op students). Examples: [OPEN@RIT](https://openr.it/) ([github](https://github.com/FOSSRIT)), [Student Government](https://www.rit.edu/studentgovernment/)
- **Club FOSS** - Software made by student clubs and similar organizations (like Special Interest Houses) at RIT. Examples: 
  - [The Construct](https://github.com/TheConstructRIT)
  - [Computer Science House](https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/)
  - [Linux Users Group](https://github.com/ritlug)
